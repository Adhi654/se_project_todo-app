# Simple Todo App

A minimal and efficient Todo List app that helps users manage daily tasks with ease. Add, complete, and remove items — all within a sleek, interactive interface. Built with modern JavaScript and BEM-based CSS structure.

## Functionality

This app offers the following key features:

➕ Add new to-do items via a popup form

✅ Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted

🗑️ Delete tasks easily

⌨️ Submit tasks by pressing Enter

🔒 Form validation to ensure meaningful input

🧠 Unique id generation for each task using the uuid package

📦 Modular design using ES6 classes for scalability

The to-do items are created, updated, and rendered dynamically with JavaScript, using Todo and FormValidator classes. Every class handles a single responsibility to keep the code clean and organized.

## Technology

HTML5 — Semantic and accessible structure

CSS3 (BEM) — Modular styles organized via Flat BEM methodology

JavaScript ES6+ — Uses classes, modules, const/let, and modern syntax
